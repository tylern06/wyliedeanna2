          Deanna and Wylie know of each other from middle school. However, through the years and school moves they never became friends. When Deanna turned 21, Wylie attended her birthday party through mutal friends. They clicked and the rest was history.

          This past year, Deanna and Wylie traveled to Europe for the first time. They hung out at pubs in London, ate too many macarons in Paris, and discovered their love of tapas in Barcelona. One morning in Paris, Wylie took extra long to get readyâ€¦ ironed his shirt and styled his hair just right. Little did Deanna know, he was to propose to her right at sunset atop the Eiffel Tower.
